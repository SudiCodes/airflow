# Apache Airflow Repository

This repository contains code and configuration for running workflows using Apache Airflow.

## Overview

Apache Airflow is an open-source platform used for programmatically authoring, scheduling, and monitoring workflows. It allows you to define complex workflows as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and provides a rich set of operators and tools to manage and execute these workflows.

In this repository, you will find:

- DAGs: Directed Acyclic Graphs that define the workflows you want to run.
- Configuration Files: Settings and configurations for Airflow.
- Scripts: Custom scripts or utilities used within the workflows.
- Documentation: Additional information and resources related to Airflow and the workflows.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/SudiCodes/airflow.git

```

2. Install Airflow and its dependencies:

```shell
Copy code
pip install "apache-airflow[celery]==2.6.1" --constraint "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-2.6.1/constraints-3.7.txt"
```

3. Configure Airflow:

Update the Airflow configuration files in the config directory to match your environment and preferences.
Set up the required connections and variables in the Airflow UI or via the Airflow command line.
Start the Airflow scheduler and web server:

```shell
Copy code
airflow scheduler
airflow webserver
Add or modify DAGs:
```

4. Create or modify DAG files in the dags directory to define your workflows.
   Use the Airflow operators and tools to design and orchestrate your workflows.
   Monitor and manage your workflows:

Access the Airflow web interface (http://localhost:8080) to monitor and manage your DAGs and task executions.
Explore the logs and visual representations of your workflows.
